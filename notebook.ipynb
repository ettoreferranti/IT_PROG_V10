Opens the file again in read mode\n5. Reads and prints the content\n\n**Hint:** Use `open()` with mode `'w'` for writing and `'r'` for reading."

Opens `numbers.txt`\n2. Uses a `for` loop to iterate through the file\n3. Prints each line (use `end=''` in print to avoid double newlines)\n4. Calculates and prints the sum of all numbers\n\n**Hint:** Remember that file reading returns strings! Use `int()` to convert to numbers."

Read the file and store restaurants in a list\n3. Use `random.choice()` to pick a random restaurant\n4.
