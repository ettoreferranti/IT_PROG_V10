    "- The buffer is full\n",
    "- You call `flush()`\n",
    "- The program ends\n",

    "\n",
    "### File I/O Workflow\n",
    "1. **Open** the file with `open(filename, mode)`\n",
    "2. **Read** or **Write** data\n",
    "3. **Close** the file (automatic with `with` block)\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Modes\n",
    "- `'r'` - Read (default)\n",
    "- `'w'` - Write (overwrites existing file)\n",
    "- `'a'` - Append (adds to end of file)\n",
    "- `'r+'` - Read and write\n",
    "- `'w+'` - Write and read\n",
    "- `'a+'` - Append and read\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Methods\n",
    "- `readline()` - Read one line\n",
    "- `readlines()` - Read all lines into a list\n",
    "- `read()` - Read entire file as string\n",
    "- `for line in file:` - Iterate through lines (preferred!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "1. Always use `with` blocks\n",
    "2. Handle exceptions with `try-except`\n",
    "3. Use `os.path.join()` for file paths\n",
    "4. Close files properly (automatic with `with`)\n",
    "5. Strip newline characters with `.strip()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Exceptions\n",
    "- `IOError` / `FileNotFoundError` - File doesn't exist\n",
    "- `PermissionError` - No permission to access file\n",
    "- `IsADirectoryError` - Tried to open a directory as a file"
