Forgot to close the file!\n# Try to read it now...\n```\n\n**Problem 2: File Still \"Locked\"**\n\n```python\n# Open a file but don't close it\nf = open('locked.txt', 'w')\nf.write('Some data')\n# File is still open!\n\n# Try to open it again in another part of code\n# (Uncomment to see the problem)\n# f2 = open('locked.txt', 'r')  # Might cause issues!\n```\n\n**The Solution:**\n\n```python\n# Manually close - but easy to forget!\nf = open('incomplete.txt', 'w')\nf.write('This will be written!')\nf.close()  # Must remember this!\n\n# Or use flush() to force writing\nf = open('flushed.txt', 'w')\nf.write('Forced to write')\nf.flush()  # Writes immediately\nf.close()\n```\n\n**Try this experiment:**\n\n1. Run the code that forgets to close\n2. Check if the file contains the data (it might not!)\n3. Then properly close the file and check again\n\n**Why this happens:** Python buffers (temporarily stores) data for efficiency. The data only gets written when:\n- The file is closed\n- The buffer is full\n- You call `flush()`\n- The program ends\n\n**Lesson:** Always close your files!

    "## Summary and Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### File I/O Workflow\n",
    "1. **Open** the file with `open(filename, mode)`\n",
    "2. **Read** or **Write** data\n",
    "3. **Close** the file (automatic with `with` block)\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Modes\n",
    "- `'r'` - Read (default)\n",
    "- `'w'` - Write (overwrites existing file)\n",
    "- `'a'` - Append (adds to end of file)\n",
    "- `'r+'` - Read and write\n",
    "- `'w+'` - Write and read\n",
    "- `'a+'` - Append and read\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Methods\n",
    "- `readline()` - Read one line\n",
    "- `readlines()` - Read all lines into a list\n",
    "- `read()` - Read entire file as string\n",
    "- `for line in file:` - Iterate through lines (preferred!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "1. ✅ Always use `with` blocks\n",
    "2. ✅ Handle exceptions with `try-except`\n",
    "3. ✅ Use `os.path.join()` for file paths\n",
    "4. ✅ Close files properly (automatic with `with`)\n",
    "5. ✅ Strip newline characters with `.strip()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Exceptions\n",
    "- `IOError` / `FileNotFoundError` - File doesn't exist\n",
    "- `PermissionError` - No permission to access file\n",
    "- `IsADirectoryError` - Tried to open a directory as a file"
